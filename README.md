# shortly-deploy

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with fellow students [Nick Havens](https://github.com/npHavens/) and [Abishak Kodi](https://github.com/abishakkodi).

It is a URL shortener similar to [bit.ly](https://bit.ly) and makes use of:
* [node](https://nodejs.org)
* [express](https://expressjs.com) 
* [sqlite](https://sqlite.org)
* [mongo](https://mongodb.com)
* [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)
* [backbone](https://backbonejs.org)
* [bookshelf](https://bookshelfjs.org)
* [heroku](https://heroku.com)
* [digitalocean](https://digitalocean.com)
* [grunt](https://gruntjs.com)

amongst other technologies.
